## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to control an external LED using a microcontroller. The LED will turn on and off with a 1-second interval, providing a basic understanding of controlling digital outputs.

## Materials Needed

- 1 x LED
- 1 x Resistor (appropriate value for your LED)
- 1 x TRIOE Microcontroller
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**

   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the microcontroller.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin on the microcontroller.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - First, you need to download the Trioe library. You can find it on GitHub or another repository that hosts it.
   - Install the Trioe library into your Arduino IDE. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
     - Open your Arduino IDE.
     - Go to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries...`.
     - In the Library Manager, search for "Trioe" and install it.
   - After installing the library, you need to open the example code for Smart_Building_Kit_Beginner_Blink_Act_2:
     - Go to `File -> Examples -> Trioe -> Smart_Building_Kit_Beginner_Blink_Act_2`.
   - Connect your Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

## Usage

1. **Arduino Code:**

   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click the Upload button to upload the code to the microcontroller.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the external LED should start blinking with a 1-second interval.
