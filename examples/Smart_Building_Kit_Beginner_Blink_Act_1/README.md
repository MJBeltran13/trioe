## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using a microcontroller. The LED will turn on and off with a 1-second interval, providing a basic understanding of controlling digital outputs.

## Materials Needed

- 1 x LED
- 1 x Resistor (appropriate value for your LED)
- 1 x Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to a digital pin on the microcontroller.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin on the microcontroller.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - If using an Arduino, download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Connect your Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

## Usage

1. **Arduino Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy and paste the following code into the IDE:

     ```cpp
     // Pin number where the LED is connected
     const int ledPin = 13;

     void setup() {
       // Initialize the digital pin as an output
       pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
     }

     void loop() {
       // Turn the LED on
       digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
       // Wait for a second
       delay(1000);
       // Turn the LED off
       digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
       // Wait for a second
       delay(1000);
     }
     ```

   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click the Upload button to upload the code to the Arduino.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the LED should start blinking with a 1-second interval.
